The project "Espresso Logic Optimization Algorithm" aims to implement a classical two-level logic minimization algorithm for Boolean functions and apply it to the optimization of Boolean expressions. Limited to the level and time, the project plans to realize the core functions of the Espresso algorithm, reflecting its spirit without seeking complete details. The specific objectives include: writing Python code of the Espresso algorithm independently, and realizing the three key functions of Boolean functions: Reduce, Expand, and Irredundant; The input logic expression is minimized based on three key function iterations,
